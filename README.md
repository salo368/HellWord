# HellWorld
Mini game made with a 2D proto-graphic engine in Java

Grapher is a project that allows visualizing and traversing graphs using towers and cables to represent nodes and edges. This project is developed in Java with Java Swing and utilizes the DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithms, as well as the Kruskal's algorithm to find the shortest path that connects all nodes.

## Features

- **2D Game Engine**: The game utilizes a custom 2D game engine developed from scratch, allowing for graphics and textures rendering on the screen.
- **Coordinates and Collisions**: The game uses a coordinate system to position and move objects on the screen. Additionally, collision detection is implemented to handle interactions between game elements.
- **Animations**: Animations system are included to make the game more dynamic and visually appealing.
- **Controls**: The player can control the main character using keyboard controls.
- **Screens and Menus**: The game includes a start screen, game screens, and possibly other menus or result screens depending on your implementation.

## Visuals

Here are some visuals that illustrate the game in action:

## System Requirements

- Java (version 1.8.0_241)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/salo368/HellWorld.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Compile and run the program.
4. Interact with the graphical interface to add nodes and edges, execute traversal algorithms, and find the shortest path.
